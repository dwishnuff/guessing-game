Project: Guessing game class 4 assignment

Description:

Class -3 Update guessing game to include a counter of *correct* answers.  As a bonus, I included a counter of *incorrect* answers and an alert at the end to display totals of both *correct* and *incorrect*. I also added a console log of correct and incorrect tally.

Class - 4 Update guessing game with functions instead of alerts.  Display messages on screen.  Added styling with CSS, this is a work in progress.  Current styling includes 3 columns, background colors, picture borders and fonts.
